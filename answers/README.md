I asked in the other README which is the most general - based on the titles of these documents you can probably guess which it is. All of these methods are implementable by `.reduce` (though some are more efficient with independent implementations). You might say "But you also show that `forEach` can do everything (just not within the bounds that you layed out...)". True. However with the `reduce` implementations, you can see that _there is nothing outside of the call to reduce_. The reduce function is doing _all_ the work of the others with no external work required. Effectively any operation on an array can be performed with a reduce (am I wrong?).
